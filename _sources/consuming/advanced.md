Library structure:

```bash
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ blocks.ts           # Block level rules
â”œâ”€â”€ directives          # All directives
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts        # { plugin, directives } a dictionary of the default directives
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admonition.ts   # Admonition directives
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ figure.ts       # Figure directive
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ roles               # All roles
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts        # { plugin, roles }, a dictionary of the default roles
    â”œâ”€â”€ html.ts         # HTML roles, like abbr, sub, sup ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ math.ts         # Math role
    â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts            # Exports `MyST()` and default roles/directives
â”œâ”€â”€ state.ts            # Handles reference numbering
â””â”€â”€ utils.ts
```

## Using `mystjs`

There are two ways to use the library, you can use the `MyST` wrapper,
which creates a `MarkdownIt` tokenizer for you:

```javascript
import { MyST } from 'mystjs';
const myst = MyST(); // Can override options here!
const html = myst.render(myString);
```

Alternatively, you can use this with other packages in a more granular way:

```javascript
import { plugins, roles, directives } from 'mystjs';

// Somewhere create a markdownit tokenizer:
const tokenizer = MarkdownIt('commonmark');

// Later:
tokenizer.use(plugins.math);
tokenizer.use(plugins.blocks);
tokenizer.use(plugins.directives(directives));
tokenizer.use(plugins.roles(roles));
```

## Developer Install

For installing the package locally, you will need [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm), both can use a global install on your system.

Once you have `npm` installed globally, navigate into this project folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd mystjs
npm install
npm run start  # Start a development server to play with the library! ðŸš€
```

## package.json scripts

The scripts for building, testing, and serving the project are in the [package.json](package.json), the main ones to use are `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run start`.

The command `npm run build` builds the library, including compiling the typescript and bundling/minification to create `myst.min.js`.
This outputs to the `dist` folder, and also includes all type definitions (`*.d.ts`).

The command `npm run test` runs the tests, these are mostly based on the [fixtures](fixtures) folder. You can also use `npm run test:watch` to run on any file changes.

The command `npm run start` starts a server for manually testing and playing with `mystjs`, this uses a in-memory bundle of what would go in the `dist` folder.
Note that this does not actually build the library!

## Typescript

`mystjs` uses Typescript in `strict` mode and `noImplicitAny`. The types are distributed with the package.

## Build Targets

The package create a `dist` folder and transpiles all code from Typescript to Javascript.
The main library can run in both the browser and in node, however, another file `myst.ts` is
used to attached the global `MyST` variable to the `window`. This file `myst.min.js`
is what should be distributed when using scripts in HTML.

Otherwise you should be using standard imports or requires in your node environment.

## Tests

The major tests that are run are against the `fixtures` directory that compare the md to the expected html output.

These have the format:

```md
.
Testing abbriviations in MyST markdown
.
This is markdown with {abbr}`MyST (Markedly reStructured Text)`!!
.

<p>This is markdown with <abbr title="Markedly reStructured Text">MyST</abbr>!!</p>
.
```
